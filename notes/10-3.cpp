/*
instance variable is tied to specific instance of class, not shared among objects of same class
static variable (class variable) is shared by all objects of class
static function cant access instance members of class
use ClassName::functionName(arguements) to invoce static function and ClassName::staticVariable to access static variables
    this imporives readability bc user can easily recognize the static function and data in class
