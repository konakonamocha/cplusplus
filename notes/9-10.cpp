/*

vector class allows storing a list of objects, without a fixed size
basically a dynamic array
included in <vector> header

vector<int> intVector;
vector<string> stringVector;

to access an element, use v.at[index] bc it will check if the index exists

vectors are passed by value (creates copy )
