/*
vector = dynamic array, stores elements of a single data type 
* is used to return the value of the objec tthat it points to

std::cout << *yPtr // this prints the value of y
    using it like this derefrences the pointer

always initialize pointers to prevent errrors
dereferenceing a pointer that is not initialized could cause a fatal runtime error or point to the wrong data
cpp has a nullptr (Null Pointer) (dont ask me what tha tis)

the const qualifier tells compiler that the value should not be modified

functions CAN return a pointer
